# Solar Radiation Project
This project was made for a kaggle competition, that you can find in the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/datamex0120/overview

## Requirements
You need to have installed the following libraries:

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. kaggle
4. zipfile
5. sklearn.model_selection
6. sklearn.metrics
7. tqdm

You need a Kaggle account and you need to set a key. other way you need to download manually the datasets. Here there are already downloaded

## Useful tools used
Here were used several tools, who can be used as examples to implement in other projects
### sklearn
Use of some models of linear regresion to predict future behaivor.
Use of root square mean error to check the eficency of the models
Use of train test split to split the dataset and train it
### zipfile
Use to opeining datasets directly from zip files
### kaggle
API of kaggle to check parameters of the competitions, download datasets and other features directly from python
